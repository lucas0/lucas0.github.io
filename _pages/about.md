I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Federal University of Ceara](http://www.ufc.br){:target="_blank"} (2009-13)from where I have also started an M.Sc. in Machine Learning (2015). During my bachelors, I was granted a sponsored exchange program to [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu){:target="_blank"} (2012-2013) where my interest in Artificial Intelligence was nourished as well as my proficiency in English. At the start of 2016, I was offered a PhD Candidate position at the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org) and moved to Ireland before finishing the M.Sc. program I had partially completed.  

During my academic career, I worked in different research groups, some of them are [ARIDA](http://www.arida.ufc.br/site/){:target="_blank"}, [ParGO](http://www.lia.ufc.br/~pargo/){:target="_blank"} and [DSI](https://dsi.nuigalway.ie){:target="_blank"} on quite various fields of graph theory, natural language processing and both relational and graph databases.

As a multidisciplinary explorer, my research experiences and academic background lie at the junction of Machine Learning, Data Science and Natural Language Processing. I am also interested in applied mathematics, less-resourced languages processing and particularly, etymology.

On my personal side, I have a great interest in knowledge about languages, currently learning Italian, after having obtained advanced level on French, English, Spanish and Portuguese(native). Back in 2000, I have been exposed to my first non-native language, by living in Argentina for a year while I was only 8 years old. I am convinced that this experience affected the way my brain reasoning over symbols and signifiers and provided me with a facility to learn different idioms. During this period I was part of the cast of a popular [Brazilian soap-opera](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154062/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast){:target="_blank"} that was live on television for 5 years, which also developed my confidence and communication skills from an early age.  

In my spare time, I like playing the guitar (mainly Spanish guitar) and I have some of my favourite tunes on this [amateur youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC42Z8UbC-NR9ZBCyC9wwaVQ/videos?view_as=subscriber). Finally, my combined interests in language, mythology and etymology feed from each other and apart from classics, I have lately been fascinated by the work of Neil Gaiman's and Alan Moore's books and graphic novels for their incredible amount of great references.
