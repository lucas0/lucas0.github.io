I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Federal University of Ceara](http://www.ufc.br){:target="_blank"} (2009-13)from where I have also started an M.Sc. in Machine Learning (2015). During my bachelors, I was granted a sponsored exchange program to [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu){:target="_blank"}(2012-2013) where my interest in Artificial Intelligence was nourished as well as my proficiency in English. At the start of 2016, I was offered a PhD Candidate position at the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org) and moved to Ireland before finishing the M.Sc. program I had partially completed.  

During my academic career, I worked in different research groups, some of them are [ARIDA](http://www.arida.ufc.br/site/){:target="_blank"}, [ParGO](http://www.lia.ufc.br/~pargo/){:target="_blank"} and [DSI](https://dsi.nuigalway.ie){:target="_blank"} on quite various fields of graph theory, natural language processing and both relational and graph databases.

As a multidisciplinary explorer, my research experiences and academic background lie at the junction of Machine Learning, Data Science and Natural Language Processing. I am also interested in applied mathematics, less-resourced languages processing and particularly, etymology.

On my personal side, I have great interest for knowledge about languages, currently learning Italian, after having obtained advanced level on French, English, Spanish and Portuguese(native). Back in 2000, I have been exposed to my first non-native language, by living in Argentina for a year while I was only 8 years old. I am convinced that this experience affected the way my brain reasoning over symbols and signifiers and provided me with a facility to learn different idioms. During this period I was part of the cast of a popular [Brazilian soap-opera](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154062/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast){:target="_blank"} that was live on television for 5 years, which also developed my confidence and communication skills from an early age.  

On my spare time, I like playing guitar (mainly spanish guitar) and I have some of my favourite tunes at this [amateur youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC42Z8UbC-NR9ZBCyC9wwaVQ/videos?view_as=subscriber). Finally, my combined interests in language, mythology and etymology feed from each other and apart from classics, I have lately been fascinated by the work of Neil Gaiman's and Alan Moore's books and graphic novels for their incredible amount of great references.  

In addition to this web site, you can find information about me at various social networks which are linked at the bottom of this page.
