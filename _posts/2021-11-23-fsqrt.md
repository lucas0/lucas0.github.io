I like a lot of algorithms for their ingeniousness and simplicity into solving problems,but one in particular stands out when those two qualities are taken into account: the fast inverse square root, created by [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack), that made it possible for personal computers from the 90â€™s to render enough surfaces as to make 3D video-gaming viable. The inverse of a square root is used to normalize the magnitude ofthe vectors that represent each surface to be rendered, thus, this operation is used extensively by the game engine. Consequently, any reduction on its computational costs would heavily impact on the overall performance of the code.

Carmack wrote his implementation of the fast inverse square root(see Algorithm 1,that includes his <s>original</s> censored comments) in the C language despite the fact that all of its needed operations were already available through the %ltmath.io%gt library. He made that in order to substitute costly operations for faster ones.
