RTE asked me to write an article about the phenomenon of fake news and how my research relates to it! Here you can access the whole text, named [How to beat fake news with algorithms](https://web.archive.org/web/20190503103926/https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2019/0125/1025444-how-to-beat-fake-news-with-algorithms/).

    A couple of weeks after the article was online, I have received a letter from the president of NUIG acknowledging and thanking me for the feat ðŸ˜Š It is always nice to receive kind words supporting your effort, isn't it?

Super happy with this one! Sometimes we underestimate the importance of reaching out to the non-academic public...
