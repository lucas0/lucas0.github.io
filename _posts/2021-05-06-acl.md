description: Great news to wrap up the PhD!
---

Another great news while approaching the end of my PhD term at [DSI-NUIG](https://dsi.nuigalway.ie): one more paper published in A rank conferences! This time, our paper publishing the final version of VERITAS and the describing LUX - along with preliminary results - is going to [ACL](https://2021.aclweb.org)!

The conference will take place between the 2nd and the 5th day of August, as a virtual meeting, which is a pitty as I would very much like to travel to Bangkok. Thanks COVID19!ðŸ˜‘

<a href="https://lucas0.github.io/assets/pdf/acl2021.pdf">Here</a> is a pre-print version of the paper entitled "LUX (Linguistic aspects Under eXamination): Discourse Analysis for Automatic Fake News Classification"!

I will update this post once the camera-ready version is done.

Edit: the published version of the article is available <a href="https://lucas0.github.io/assets/pdf/acl2021-full.pdf">Here</a>!
