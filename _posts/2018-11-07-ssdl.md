## The conference

The [2nd Summer School for Deep Learning](http://irdta.eu/deeplearn2018/) was held in Genova, Italy from the days 23rd to 23th of July. A sunny week in a beautiful city was the perfect occasion to stay inside conference rooms watching presentations and talk about the potential of what has become evermore used and omnipresent: Deep Learning.

Great talks were held by the event but a lot of the content was targeted at a more inexperienced audience, giving me a hard time staying interested. Nevertheless, keynotes and some talks were really captivating.

## Holidays

Following the pattern of past conferences, I have also taken a few days off after attending the main event to enjoy the places and the food of Italy! I have stayed a few days in Genova, then moved to Bologna and returned to Ireland from Milan.

In the library of the University of Bologna, I was mesmerized by the collection of many of the most important works from the most important scientist of the world. Something any academic would enjoy!
