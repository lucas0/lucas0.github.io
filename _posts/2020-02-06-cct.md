Got invited by [Gianna Tasha](https://www.giannatashatomasso.com) to participate in an interdisciplinary event in the [LSAD](https://lit.ie/LSAD), a marvellous and multifaceted artist that I met during a hackathon event, named [Collections as Data](https://mooreinstitute.ie/event/collections-data-hackathon-collaborative-workshop/) over old Irish archives where we were placed in the same team, to work with a collection of the Abbey Theatre Minute Books. I might describe the hackathon with more details in another blog post.

The event had several contributors presenting their work from the most diverse areas, including, performance, music, architecture, dance, volunteering, history, anthropology, etc. I was extremely interested in the talks by how unique and interesting most of them were. Highlights go to presentations by Pip Sheridan over how to recycle and reuse belongings left behind on festivals to [support refugees](https://www.facebook.com/Refugeewhistles/) in Ireland, by [Victor Sardenberg](http://victorsardenberg.com) that uses machine learning to render architectural blueprints to expose the absurdity of capitalism on living spaces and finally a great presentation by [Bernard Sweeney](https://twitter.com/1bernardsweeney) that introduced the complex and essential discussion over the Irish original people, also referred to as 'travellers'.

The city was welcoming, despite the Irish weather (which I am already used to) and the participants also had the privilege to attend a private premiere of [Paddy Mulcahy](https://paddymulcahy.com) new album, a local artist that experiments with many instruments and a lot of synths!
