I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Federal University of Ceara](http://www.ufc.br){:target="_blank"} (2009-13) where I have also started an M.Sc. in Machine Learning (2015). During my bachelors, I was granted a sponsored exchange program to [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu){:target="_blank"}(2012-2013) where my interest in Artificial Intelligence was nourished as well as my proficiency in English. At the start of 2016, I was offered a PhD Candidate position at the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org) and moved to Ireland without having the opportunity to finish the M.Sc. program I had partially completed.

During my masters, I worked in different research groups, namely at [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en){:target="_blank"}, [LIMSI](https://www.limsi.fr/en/){:target="_blank"}, and [LIPN](http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/){:target="_blank"}, on quite various fields of co-reference resolution, language generation and neural machine translation (here is one of [my master's theses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00660){:target="_blank"}). 

Back in 2013, as a member of the Kurdish Language Processing Project ([KLPP](http://klpp.github.io/){:target="_blank"}) I developed some of the fundamental language processing tools for Kurdish. I obtained my B.Sc. in Software Engineering in 2014 at [University of Kurdistan](https://en.uok.ac.ir/EN){:target="_blank"}, Faculty of Engineering.

As a multidisciplinary explorer, my research experiences and academic background lie at the junction of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am also interested in applied mathematics, less-resourced languages processing and particularly, Kurdish language processing. I still work on Kurdish-related NLP projects part-time in collaboration with [Kurdish-BLARK](https://kurdishblark.github.io/){:target="_blank"} where I am a project leader.

My first experiences in NLP date back to 2010, when I started my Bachelor's. Interested in linguistics, I was curious in creating language processing tools by extracting rules. In addition to the basic courses in programming and data strucuture, formal languages and theory of automata showed me the way towards NLP in a "formal" way. This is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4uV91s7W2o){:target="_blank"} of my spell-checker and translator (Kurdish &#8596; English/Persian/Arabic)) for Kurdish language, implemented based on the [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex){:target="_blank"} algorithm.

On my personal side, I have great interest for knowledge about languages. Back in 2000, I have been exposed to my first non-native language, by living in Argentina for a year while I was only 8 years old. I am convinced that this experience affected the way my brain reasons over symbols and signifiers and provided me with a facility to learn different idioms. During this period I was part of the cast of a popular [Brazilian soap-opera](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154062/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast){:target="_blank"} that was live on television for 5 years, which also developed my confidence and communication skills from an early age.

On my spare time, I like playing guitar (mainly spanish guitar) and I have some of my favourite tunes at this [amateur youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC42Z8UbC-NR9ZBCyC9wwaVQ/videos?view_as=subscriber). Finally, my combined interests in language, mythology and etymology feed from each other and apart from classics, I also enjoy Neil Gaiman's and Alan Moore's graphic novels for their incredible amount of great references.

In addition to this web site, you can find information about me at various social networks outlets which are linked to in the left section.
